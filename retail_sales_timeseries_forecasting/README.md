# Retail Sales Timeseries Forecasting


## Project Background
How much camping gear will one store sell each month in a year? To the uninitiated, calculating sales at this level may seem as difficult as predicting the weather. Both types of forecasting rely on science and historical data. While a wrong weather forecast may result in you carrying around an umbrella on a sunny day, inaccurate business forecasts could result in actual or opportunity losses. In this competition, in addition to traditional forecasting methods you’re also challenged to use machine learning to improve forecast accuracy.

## Data
Hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.

The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels.
