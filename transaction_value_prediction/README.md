# Transaction Value Prediction


## Project Background
According to Epsilon research, 80% of customers are more likely to do business with you if you provide personalized service. Banking is no exception.

The digitalization of everyday lives means that customers expect services to be delivered in a personalized and timely manner… and often before they´ve even realized they need the service. The objective is to determine the amount or value of the customer's transaction. This means anticipating customer needs in a more concrete, but also simple and personal way. With so many choices for financial services, this need is greater now than ever before.

Help identify the value of transactions for each potential customer. This is a towards personalization of service.
