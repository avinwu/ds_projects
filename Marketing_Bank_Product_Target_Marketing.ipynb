The bank can then focus its marketing efforts on those customers.

    "By applying logistic and ridge regression algorithms, classification and estimation model were successfully built. With these two models, the bank will be able to predict a customer's response to its telemarketing campaign before calling this customer. In this way, the bank can allocate more marketing efforts to the clients who are classified as highly likely to accept term deposits, and call less to those who are unlikely to make term deposits.\n",

    "In addition, predicting duration before calling and adjusting marketing plan benefit both the bank and its clients. On the one hand, it will increase the efficiency of the bank’s telemarketing campaign, saving time and efforts. On the other hand, it prevents some clients from receiving undesirable advertisements, raising customer satisfaction. With the aid of logistic and ridge regression models, the bank can enter a virtuous cycle of effective marketing, more investments and happier customers."

    "**1. More appropriate timing**\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a marketing strategy, external factors, such as the time of calling, should also be carefully considered. The previous analysis points out that March, September, October and December had the highest success rates. Nevertheless, more data should be collected and analyzed to make sure that this seasonal effect is constant over time. If the trend has the potential to continue in the future, the bank should consider initiating its telemarketing campaign in fall and spring.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Smarter marketing design**\n",
    "\n",
    "By targeting the right customers, the bank will have more and more positive responses, and the classification algorithms would ultimately eliminate the imbalance in the original dataset. Hence, more accurate information will be presented to the bank for improving the subscriptions. Meanwhile, to increase the likelihood of subscription, the bank should re-evaluate the content and design of its current campaign, making it more appealing to its target customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Better services provision**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a more granular understanding of its customer base, the bank has the ability to provide better banking services.\n",
    "For example, marital status and occupation reveal a customer's life stage while loan status indicates his/her overall risk profile. With this information, the bank can estimate when a customer might need to make an investment. In this way, the bank can better satisfy its customer demand by providing banking services for the right customer at the right time."
